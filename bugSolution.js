The solution is to update the outdated libraries to support the latest version of React 19. This might involve checking the library's documentation or release notes to confirm compatibility.  If updating isn't possible, consider switching to a different library that is React 19 compatible. Here's an example where we update a hypothetical 'legacy-lib' package:

```javascript
npm update legacy-lib
```

After updating, verify the behavior is corrected and test thoroughly.
